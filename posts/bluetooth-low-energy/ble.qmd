> The BLE protocol is commonly used but complex, so I decided to glance at its framework.


*TBD*: security, sniffer. [*course site*](https://academy.nordicsemi.com/courses/bluetooth-low-energy-fundamentals/)


* Basic Concepts:
    * Protocol Stack
    ![protocol stack diagrams](https://academy.nordicsemi.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/MicrosoftTeams-image-29.png)

    - Host
        - L2CAP(Logical Link Control & Adaptaion Protocol): encapsulating service for upper layers
        - SMP(Security Manager Protocol): defines and provides secure communication
        - ATT(Attribute Protocol): pieces of data exposed to other devices
        - GATT(Generic Attribute Profile): sub-procedures for using the the ATT layer
        - GAP(Generic Access Profile): devices discovery and connection-related services
    - Controller:
        - PHY(Physical Layer): modulate datas onto the waves and receive data from waves
        - LL(Link Layer): manage the state(standby, advertising, scanning, initialing, connection) of the radio


    * Roles
        - Advertising & Scanning
        - Central & Peripheral  
            The central scans the packets advertising by the peripherals and can initial a connection by sending a connection request.  
            Peripheral generally use less power than central
        - Broadcast & Observer
            Broadcast & Listen advertisement without connection.
            
    * GATT
        - Server: store data and provide methods for client to access data.
        - Client: access data on the server
      
        - Attribute: a standard data representation format
        - The Generic Attribute Profile
        ![GAP](https://academy.nordicsemi.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/blefund_less1_example_profile-1.png)
        
        - [GATT defined by the Bluetooth SIG(Special Interest Group)](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/specs/)

    * Radio Modes
        - 1M PHY / 2M PHY: xMbps
        - coded PHY: S symbols represent 1 bit to achieve longer communication.
          
* Advertising
    * channels: 40 channels in BLE, 3 primary channels is mainly for advertisement and 37 secondary channels mainly used for data transfer after connecting.
    * Scan Interval & Scan Window(the time in each interval)
    * Scan Request & Response:
        - Request: sent by central to request extra information without adevertising
        - Response: respond to a scan request
          ![schematic diagram](https://academy.nordicsemi.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/blefund_less2_scan_request-2.png)
    * Extended advertising: the primary advertisement channels are pointing to supplementary information that is being advertised on the secondary advertisement channel.
    * types:
        - connectable & non-connectable
        - scannable & non-scannable
        - directed & undirected
    * Address: a unique 48-bit address
        - Public address: pay and register with IEEE registration authority
        - Random address: 
            - static or private
            - private: resolvable or non-resolvable  
            resolvable: use a pre-shared key IRK(Identity Resolving Key) to generate and resolve the random address. 
    * Packet Structure
        - PDU(Protocol Data Unit):
            - Advertising (channel) PDU
            - Data (channel) PDU
        ![packet structure](https://academy.nordicsemi.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/blefund_less2_adv_packet-1.png)
        
        - Advertisement PDU Header
        ![](https://academy.nordicsemi.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/blefund_less2_PDU_header-.png)
            - RFU: Reserved for future use
            - ChSel: set to 1 if LE Channel Selection Algorithm #2 is supported
            - TxAdd: 0/1. transmitter address is public or random
            - RxAdd: 0/1. receiver address is public or random
            - Length: payload length
        - Advertisement PDU Payload
        ![](https://academy.nordicsemi.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/blefund_less2_PDU_payload_2-1.png)
            - AdvA: Bluetooth address of the advertising device (48bits)
            - AdvData: data packet

* Connection
    * Disconnect: by application, by supervision timeout
    * Parameters:
        - Connection interval   
        - Supervision timeout: successfully receiving the last packet before the connection is considered lost
        - Peripheral latency: allow skip waking up for a certain number of connection events if it doesn't have any data to send
        - PHY radio modes: 1/2M, coded PHY
        - Data Length & MTU(Maximum Transfer Unit): MTU is the number of bytes that can be sent in one GATT operation. Data Length is the number of bytes can be sent in one BLE packet.
            - DLE(Data Length Extension): allow the data length increases from 27 bytes to 251 bytes to save time and power.
        - Update the connection parameters
            - connection interval, supervision timeout and peripheral latency: directed by the central, but the peripheral can request changes
            - PHY radio modes, data length and MTU: set to the default values when a connection is first established. Either device can request to update the parameters, the other device will then either its supported values or state it is not supported.
              
* Data Exchange in BLE
    * GATT operations
        - client-initiated: read, write, write without response
        - server-initiated: notify, indicate(an acknowledgement is required from client)  
          Though the operations initiated by the server, the client is required to enable them first by subscribing the characteristic and enabling either notifications or indications.
    * ATT layer
        - Attributes
        ![](https://academy.nordicsemi.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/blefund_less4_attribute.png)
            - Handle: 16-bit unique index in the attribute table assigned by the stack
            - UUID: universally unique id tell the attribute type
                - First Type: SIG defined 16-bit UUID
                - Second Type: vendor-specific 128-bit UUID. Insert custom 16-bit IDs in the base UUID
            - Permission: sercurity level(encryption and authorization)
            - Value: the actual data or the information about other attributes
        * Services and Characteristics
            - Service
            ![schematic diagram](https://academy.nordicsemi.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/blefund_less4_characteristics_1.png)
                - Service declaration attribute: starts a service
                - Characteristic definition attribute:
                    - Characteristic declaration attribute: holds the metadata about the Characteristic value attribute
                    - Characteristic value attribute: holds the actual user data
                    - Characteristic descriptor attribute(optional): holds more metadata about the characteristics  
                    - CCCD(Client Characteristic Configuration Descriptor): writable for client to enable/disable server-initiated operations notify and indicate
